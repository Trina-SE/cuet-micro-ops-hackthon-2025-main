## The Scenario

This microservice simulates a **real-world file download system** where processing times vary significantly:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        Download Processing Time                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Fast Downloads    ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ~10-15s    │
│  Medium Downloads  ████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ~30-60s    │
│  Slow Downloads    ████████████████████████████████████████  ~60-120s   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why does this matter?**

When you deploy this service behind a reverse proxy (Cloudflare, nginx, AWS ALB), you'll encounter:

| Problem                 | Impact                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Connection Timeouts** | Cloudflare's 100s timeout kills long requests |
| **Gateway Errors**      | Users see 504 errors for slow downloads       |
| **Poor UX**             | No progress feedback during long waits        |
| **Resource Waste**      | Open connections consume server memory        |

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
# Start the server (10-120s random delays)
npm run start

# This request will likely timeout (REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=30s)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/download/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_id": 70000}'

# Watch the server logs - you'll see:
# [Download] Starting file_id=70000 | delay=85.3s (range: 10s-120s) | enabled=true
```

**Your challenge:** Design solutions that handle these variable processing times gracefully!

| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Challenge 1: S3 Storage Integration | 15         | Medium     |
| Challenge 2: Architecture Design    | 15         | Hard       |
| Challenge 3: CI/CD Pipeline         | 10         | Medium     |

| **Maximum Total**                   | **50**     |            |

### Challenge 2: Long-Running Download Architecture

The API now implements the asynchronous polling design described in `ARCHITECTURE.txt`:

- `POST /v1/download/initiate` immediately returns `{ jobId, nextPollInMs, expiresAt }` and enqueues the work in an in-memory BullMQ-inspired queue. Requests accept optional `clientRequestId`, `priority`, and `userId` fields to deduplicate submissions.
- `GET /v1/download/status/:jobId` exposes progress, attempts, timestamps, and the eventual presigned URL metadata so browsers can poll without holding the original connection open.
- `GET /v1/download/:jobId` redirects to the short-lived download URL (or returns JSON when `?format=json` is provided). If the job is still running, it returns HTTP 409 alongside the latest status payload.

Simulated workers respect environment variables like `DOWNLOAD_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`, `DOWNLOAD_DELAY_*`, and `DOWNLOAD_JOB_TTL_MS`. Jobs transition through `queued → running → processing_artifacts → completed/failed`, and expired jobs are cleaned up automatically.

To demonstrate frontend integration, a lightweight React dashboard lives under `frontend/`. It stores job IDs in `localStorage`, polls `/v1/download/status/:jobId` every five seconds, and links directly to `/v1/download/:jobId` once completed. Run it with:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to target remote deployments.

---

### Challenge 4: Observability Dashboard (Bonus)

- `frontend/` now hosts the **Download Observability Dashboard**. It shows health, job progress, error logs, a trace viewer, and live performance metrics while automatically persisting jobs and instrumenting every request.
- `@sentry/react` wraps the entire UI with an error boundary, captures failed API calls, and exposes the “Send Feedback” dialog. Set `SENTRY_DSN` in `.env` and `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (or build-time environment variables for Docker) to wire it to your project.
- Frontend OpenTelemetry instrumentation (see `frontend/src/observability.ts`) starts spans for all user interactions, injects `traceparent` headers, and exports them via OTLP/HTTP to the Jaeger all-in-one collector (`http://localhost:4318/v1/traces`). Traces appear instantly under `http://localhost:16686`.
- Docker Compose now ships a monitoring stack: Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, and Node Exporter. Prometheus scrapes `delineate-node-exporter:9100`, and Grafana auto-loads a Node overview dashboard (http://localhost:3001, admin/admin). The frontend container runs on http://localhost:4173.
- Trigger the Sentry smoke test anytime with:  
  `curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/v1/download/check?sentry_test=true" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"file_id":70000}'`.

### Challenge 1: Self-Hosted S3 Storage Integration

#### Your Mission

The current Docker configuration does not include a self-hosted S3-compatible storage service. Your challenge is to:

1. **Modify the Docker Compose files** (`docker/compose.dev.yml` and/or `docker/compose.prod.yml`) to include a self-hosted S3-compatible storage service
2. **Configure the API** to connect to your storage service
3. **Verify** the health endpoint returns `"storage": "ok"`

#### Recommended S3-Compatible Storage Options

##### Option 1: RustFS (Recommended)

[RustFS](https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs) is a lightweight, high-performance S3-compatible object storage written in Rust.

##### Option 2: MinIO

[MinIO](https://min.io) is a popular, production-ready S3-compatible object storage.

#### Requirements

Your solution must:

- [ ] Add an S3-compatible storage service to Docker Compose
- [ ] Create the required bucket (`downloads`) on startup
- [ ] Configure proper networking between services
- [ ] Update environment variables to connect the API to storage
- [ ] Pass all E2E tests (`npm run test:e2e`)
- [ ] Health endpoint must return `{"status": "healthy", "checks": {"storage": "ok"}}`

#### Hints

1. The API expects these S3 environment variables:
   - `S3_ENDPOINT` - Your storage service URL (e.g., `http://delineate-storage:9000` when using the bundled RustFS service)
   - `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Access key
   - `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Secret key
   - `S3_BUCKET_NAME` - Bucket name (use `downloads`)
   - `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` - Set to `true` for self-hosted S3

2. Services in Docker Compose can communicate using service names as hostnames

3. You may need an init container or script to create the bucket

4. Check the `/health` endpoint to verify storage connectivity

#### Testing Your Solution

```bash
# Run the full test suite
npm run test:e2e

# Or test manually
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","checks":{"storage":"ok"}}

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/download/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_id": 70000}'
```

---

### Challenge 2: Long-Running Download Architecture Design

#### The Problem

This microservice handles file downloads that can vary significantly in processing time:

- **Fast downloads**: Complete within ~10 seconds
- **Slow downloads**: Can take up to 120+ seconds

When integrating this service with a frontend application or external services behind a reverse proxy (like **Cloudflare**, **nginx**, or **AWS ALB**), you will encounter critical issues:

1. **Connection Timeouts**: Proxies like Cloudflare have default timeouts (100 seconds) and will terminate long-running HTTP connections
2. **User Experience**: Users waiting 2+ minutes with no feedback leads to poor UX
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Holding HTTP connections open for extended periods consumes server resources
4. **Retry Storms**: If a client's connection is dropped, they may retry, creating duplicate work

#### Experience the Problem

```bash
# Start with production delays (10-120 seconds)
npm run start

# Try to download - this will likely timeout!
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/download/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_id": 70000}'

# Server logs will show something like:
# [Download] Starting file_id=70000 | delay=95.2s (range: 10s-120s) | enabled=true
# But your request times out at 30 seconds (REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS)
```

#### Your Mission

Write a **complete implementation plan** that addresses how to integrate this download microservice with a fullstack application while handling variable download times gracefully.

#### Deliverables

Create a document (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) that includes:

##### 1. Architecture Diagram

- Visual representation of the proposed system
- Show all components and their interactions
- Include data flow for both fast and slow downloads

##### 2. Technical Approach

Choose and justify ONE of these patterns (or propose your own):

**Option A: Polling Pattern**

```
Client → POST /download/initiate → Returns jobId immediately
Client → GET /download/status/:jobId (poll every N seconds)
Client → GET /download/:jobId (when ready)
```

**Option B: WebSocket/SSE Pattern**

```
Client → POST /download/initiate → Returns jobId
Client → WS /download/subscribe/:jobId (real-time updates)
Server → Pushes progress updates → Client
```

**Option C: Webhook/Callback Pattern**

```
Client → POST /download/initiate { callbackUrl: "..." }
Server → Processes download asynchronously
Server → POST callbackUrl with result when complete
```

**Option D: Hybrid Approach**

Combine multiple patterns based on use case.

##### 3. Implementation Details

For your chosen approach, document:

- **API contract changes** required to the existing endpoints
- **New endpoints** that need to be created
- **Database/cache schema** for tracking job status
- **Background job processing** strategy (queue system, worker processes)
- **Error handling** and retry logic
- **Timeout configuration** at each layer

##### 4. Proxy Configuration

Provide example configurations for handling this with:

- Cloudflare (timeout settings, WebSocket support)
- nginx (proxy timeouts, buffering)
- Or your preferred reverse proxy

##### 5. Frontend Integration

Describe how a React/Next.js frontend would:

- Initiate downloads
- Show progress to users
- Handle completion/failure states
- Implement retry logic

#### Hints

1. Consider what happens when a user closes their browser mid-download
2. Think about how to handle multiple concurrent downloads per user
3. Consider cost implications of your chosen queue/database system
4. Research: Redis, BullMQ, AWS SQS, Server-Sent Events, WebSockets
5. Look into presigned S3 URLs for direct downloads

### Challenge 3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

#### Your Mission

Set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for this service using a cloud provider's CI/CD platform. The pipeline must run all tests automatically on every push.

#### Requirements

##### Choose One Cloud Provider

GitHub Actions

##### Pipeline Stages

Your pipeline must include these stages:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│    Lint     │───▶│    Test     │───▶│    Build    │───▶│   Deploy    │
│  (ESLint,   │    │   (E2E)     │    │  (Docker)   │    │ (Optional)  │
│  Prettier)  │    │             │    │             │    │             │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

##### Deliverables

1. **Pipeline Configuration File**
   - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (GitHub Actions)

2. **Pipeline must**:
   - [x] Trigger on push to `main`/`master` branch
   - [x] Trigger on pull requests
   - [x] Run linting (`npm run lint`)
   - [x] Run format check (`npm run format:check`)
   - [x] Run E2E tests (`npm run test:e2e`)
   - [x] Build Docker image
   - [x] Cache dependencies for faster builds
   - [x] Fail fast on errors
   - [x] Report test results clearly

3. **Documentation**
   - CI/CD section added to README

#### CI/CD Pipeline Status

The CI/CD pipeline is fully implemented and running on every push and pull request.

#### Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and includes the following jobs:

- **Lint**: Runs ESLint and Prettier format check
- **Test**: Executes E2E tests
- **Build**: Builds the Docker image
- **Security Scan**: Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities using Trivy
- **Deploy**: Pushes the Docker image to GitHub Container Registry (on main branch pushes)

#### Instructions for Contributors

1. **Before pushing code**:
   - Run linting: `npm run lint`
   - Check formatting: `npm run format:check`
   - Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
   - Ensure all tests pass locally

2. **Code formatting**:
   - Use `npm run format` to auto-format code
   - Use `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix linting issues

3. **Testing**:
   - E2E tests simulate the full download workflow
   - Tests verify API endpoints, job processing, and storage integration

4. **Pull Requests**:
   - All checks must pass before merging
   - Pipeline runs on every PR to ensure quality

#### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Start with Docker (development)
npm run docker:dev
```

##### Bonus Points Implemented

- **Security Scanning**: Added Trivy vulnerability scanner for Docker images
- **Automatic Deployment**: Images are pushed to GitHub Container Registry on successful builds
- **Caching**: Node modules and Docker layers are cached for faster builds

### Challenge 4: Observability Dashboard (Bonus)

#### Your Mission

Build a simple React UI that integrates with **Sentry** for error tracking and **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing, providing visibility into the download service's health and performance.

#### Testing Sentry Integration

The API includes a built-in way to test Sentry error tracking:

```bash
# Trigger an intentional error for Sentry testing
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/v1/download/check?sentry_test=true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_id": 70000}'

# Response: {"error":"Internal Server Error","message":"Sentry test error..."}
# This error should appear in your Sentry dashboard!
```

#### Requirements

##### 1. React Application Setup

Create a React application (using Vite or Next.js) that:

- Connects to this download API
- Displays download job status
- Shows real-time error tracking
- Visualizes trace data

##### 2. Sentry Integration

**Features to implement**:

- [ ] Error boundary wrapping the entire app
- [ ] Automatic error capture for failed API calls
- [ ] User feedback dialog on errors
- [ ] Performance monitoring for page loads
- [ ] Custom error logging for business logic errors

##### 3. OpenTelemetry Integration

**Features to implement**:
